# Flower_Species_Classification_and_Car_Detection
Classification and object detection are two important problems to be solved for developing automatic systems. The evolution of machine learning, especially deep learning, has showcased astounding success in performing these tasks. With that inspiration, this work performs a classification task on a flower species dataset and an object detection task on car detection dataset with the help of deep neural networks. The neural networks are built up from scratch and the concept of
image processing has also been applied to perform these tasks.
